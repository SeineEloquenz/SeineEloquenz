### Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alexander Linder. I'm a M.Sc. Student at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu). Welcome to my gh page!

<br>

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently preparing my Thesis on Anonymous Communications in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks at the [Chair of Practical IT-Security at KIT](https://ps.kastel.kit.edu).
- ðŸ¤¿ Still diving deep into Nix and NixOS, having packaged some software in flakes.
- ðŸ‘¯ Furthermore I'm trying to alleviate student pain and dread by creating browser extensions that improve the usage of the ILIAS System at KIT which is atrocious at times. You'll find them pinned.
