### Hello there 👋, I'm Alexander Linder. I'm a CS Student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Welcome to my gh page!

<br>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my bachelor's thesis about implementing a serialization mechanism for Java and verifying its correctness with the help of [KeY](https://www.key-project.org/).
- 👯 Furthermore I'm trying to alleviate student pain and dread by creating browser extensions that improve the usage of the ILIAS System at KIT which is atrocious at times. You'll find them pinned.
